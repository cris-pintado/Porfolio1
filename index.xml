      <description>This paper addresses the challenges of standardizing habitat classification across three conterminous European countries by presenting a comparative analysis of habitat data for Portugal, Spain and
France with focus on the cross-border regions between these countries. This master's dissertation contributes to the InCASE project -In Situ
showcase Supporting Climate and Environmental Monitoring
in Europe- funded by the European Commission in support
to the European Environmental Agency (EEA) and the
Copernicus InSitu Component </description>

      <title>Experimental Approaches for Geometric Correction</title>

      <description>GoExperimental outlook for geometric correction of various remote imaging sources utilizing manual and automatics approach. This project tries to convey the procedure of geometric corrections of satellite images that are not
            georeferenced directly, and are assigned arbitrary coordinate units of pixels, and converting them into a
            desired georeferenced coordinate system, using both manual and automatic models.</description>

      <description>Having geometrically referenced images poses challenges, including atmospheric
  conditions, varied illumination due to solar position at acquisition time, and reliefinduced shadows. These factors deviate from the desired traits for remote sensing. This
  endeavor aims to outline the procedures involved in acquiring and radiometrically
  correcting satellite orthoimages, like Landsat-5 TM, utilizing both manual and automatic
  applications. The goal of radiometric correction is to transform digital sensor values into
  meaningful physical quantities, such as reflectance.</description>

      <description>Description: The goal of this project is to use data from the ChEMBL Database to train a model that can predict the activity of a potential drug based on its chemical properties. This can be used to study the chemical features that are critical in the drug effectiveness, and to study best molecular targets to act upon the specific disease.
In this project I will focus on studying possible drugs targeting proteins with a role in prostate cancer development üß´üî¨‚öô.</description>

      <description>Description: In this project we will tackle a multi-classification problem using supervised ML on a well-known dataset containing red wine quality parameters. Find the dataset here. This dataset contains quality parameters for 1596 red-wines, which we can use to build a model that predicts red wine quality. Following analyses of feature distribution and data preprocessing, several classification models were trained and their performance assessed. Three models (SVC, RFC and ETC) were chosed, tuned and ensembled using sorf voting classifier üç∑‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</description>

      <description>Description üî¨üß¨üß´üå±üåæ: In this section I would like to give a brief example of all the steps involved in the data analysis process as a crop scientist. Here I provide a simple experiment that I carried out during my PhD as example. Furthermore, I discuss my experience analysing complex biological data, and how I summarized 300Gb of proteomic data into to a single figure. I think that this comes to show the importance of learning data analytic skills and tools.</description>

      <description>Description üî¨üß¨üß´üå±üåæ: The goal of this project was to better understand the role of a set of tomato pathogenesis-related genes (PR genes) agaist an economically devastating fungus (B.cinerea).
Two main aspects of these genes were studied:
1. PR gene expression level by q-RT-PCR: During this experiment, we analized the constitutive expression level of the PR genes in different tomato plant parts (Figure 1). In order to do so, plant samples were immediately snap-frozen and crushed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80¬∞C.</description>
