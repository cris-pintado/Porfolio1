      <description>This paper addresses the challenges of standardizing habitat classification across three conterminous European countries by presenting a comparative analysis of habitat data for Portugal, Spain and
France with focus on the cross-border regions between these countries. This master's dissertation contributes to the InCASE project -In Situ
showcase Supporting Climate and Environmental Monitoring
in Europe- funded by the European Commission in support
to the European Environmental Agency (EEA) and the
Copernicus InSitu Component </description>

      <title>Experimental Approaches for Geometric Correction</title>

      <description>GoExperimental outlook for geometric correction of various remote imaging sources utilizing manual and automatics approach. This project tries to convey the procedure of geometric corrections of satellite images that are not
            georeferenced directly, and are assigned arbitrary coordinate units of pixels, and converting them into a
            desired georeferenced coordinate system, using both manual and automatic models.</description>

      <title>Radiometric Image Correction</title>

      <description>Having geometrically referenced images poses challenges, including atmospheric
  conditions, varied illumination due to solar position at acquisition time, and reliefinduced shadows. These factors deviate from the desired traits for remote sensing. This
  endeavor aims to outline the procedures involved in acquiring and radiometrically
  correcting satellite orthoimages, like Landsat-5 TM, utilizing both manual and automatic
  applications. The goal of radiometric correction is to transform digital sensor values into
  meaningful physical quantities, such as reflectance.</description>
