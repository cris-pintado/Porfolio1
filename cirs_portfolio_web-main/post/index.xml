      <description>Leaf_disease_estimator See full code here.
An App to estimate leaf spot disease scores on cereals 🌾   Description: The goal of this project was to use CNNs to predict the disease rating, from an input image.
  Introduction: Plant diseases have long been one of the major threats to food security because they dramatically reduce the crop yield and compromises its quality. Accurate and precise estimation of the disease level has been a difficult challenge.</description>

      <description>Goal of the project: To create a tool able to classify mushrooms from pictures.
Introduction: Mushrooms represent an important food source and they are used extensively in cooking 🍄👨🏼‍🍳, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Furthermore, many people enjoy mushroom collection as a outdoor activity. However, this activity, entails some health risk, since some species that are poisoness look similar to edible specimens. In the example below I present such case of similarity between a delicious and edible mushroom Macrolepiota mastoidea and a Amanita phaloides which ingestion can lead to death 💀.</description>

      <description>Framing the problem:   The unequal utilization of synonymous codons (CUB) affects numerous cellular processes i.e. translation rates, protein folding and mRNA degradation [Ref].
  The use of synonymous codons in the gene coding regions are not random, and CUB is an essential feature of most genomes, which has been reported to have an strong impact on the transcription levels of genes [Ref] 🔬📚🔠.
  Since codons within a synonymous codon group are translated at different rates, many computational translation models rely on analyzing synonymous codons.</description>

      <description>Description: The goal of this project is to use data from the ChEMBL Database to train a model that can predict the activity of a potential drug based on its chemical properties. This can be used to study the chemical features that are critical in the drug effectiveness, and to study best molecular targets to act upon the specific disease.
In this project I will focus on studying possible drugs targeting proteins with a role in prostate cancer development 🧫🔬⚙.</description>

      <description>Description: In this project we will tackle a multi-classification problem using supervised ML on a well-known dataset containing red wine quality parameters. Find the dataset here. This dataset contains quality parameters for 1596 red-wines, which we can use to build a model that predicts red wine quality. Following analyses of feature distribution and data preprocessing, several classification models were trained and their performance assessed. Three models (SVC, RFC and ETC) were chosed, tuned and ensembled using sorf voting classifier 🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</description>

      <description>Description 🔬🧬🧫🌱🌾: In this section I would like to give a brief example of all the steps involved in the data analysis process as a crop scientist. Here I provide a simple experiment that I carried out during my PhD as example. Furthermore, I discuss my experience analysing complex biological data, and how I summarized 300Gb of proteomic data into to a single figure. I think that this comes to show the importance of learning data analytic skills and tools.</description>

      <guid>https://enriquespr.github.io/Enrique_portfolio_web/post/my_kul_masters/</guid>
      <description>Description 🔬🧬🧫🌱🌾: The goal of this project was to better understand the role of a set of tomato pathogenesis-related genes (PR genes) agaist an economically devastating fungus (B.cinerea).
Two main aspects of these genes were studied:
1. PR gene expression level by q-RT-PCR: During this experiment, we analized the constitutive expression level of the PR genes in different tomato plant parts (Figure 1). In order to do so, plant samples were immediately snap-frozen and crushed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.</description>
